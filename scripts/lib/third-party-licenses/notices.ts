/**
 * Reviewed distribution analysis for copyleft / weak-copyleft packages that reach the distributed
 * set, keyed by the exact package@version shown in the closure. The generator hard-errors on any
 * such package with no entry here, so a distributor cannot ship copyleft code without having
 * recorded how its obligations are met, and a version bump re-triggers the review by design.
 *
 * Empty in the template, which ships no copyleft dependency. A derived app that pulls one (directly
 * or transitively) adds its analysis here, the same way it adds a NOTICES entry — this file is the
 * one place per-app license data lives, so the generator script itself stays identical everywhere.
